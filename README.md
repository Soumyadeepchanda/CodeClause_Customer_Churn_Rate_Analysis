# Customer_Churn_Rate_Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for analyzing customer churn rate using data analysis, model building and evaluating the model. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers ending their relationship with a company or service provider. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis is WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv which is taken from Kaggle. It includes information about various customers, such as their demographics, usage patterns, and whether they have churned or not. The dataset is provided in CSV format and can be accessed and loaded using popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas.

## Requirements
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

1.Python (version 3.7 or higher)<br>
2.Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)<br>
3.NumPy (for numerical computations)<br>
4.Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)<br>
5.Matplotlib (for data visualization)<br>
6.Jupyter Notebook (for running the code interactively)<br>

You can install these dependencies by using pip, the Python package manager. For example:
